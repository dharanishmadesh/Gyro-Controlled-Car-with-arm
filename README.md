1. **RF Module Setup (nRF24L01)**: 
   - The code uses the `RF24` library to communicate with the nRF24L01 module. It is set up to listen for incoming data on a specific pipe (`pipeIn`).
   - Data received via the RF module controls the movement of the motors.

2. **Motor Control**:
   - Two motors (right and left) are controlled using the L298N motor driver. The motor direction is determined by the `xAxis` and `yAxis` values received from the RF transmitter.
   - The motors can rotate forward, backward, or stop depending on the input values.

3. **Mapping & Constraining Motor Speeds**:
   - The `xAxis` and `yAxis` values (received from the transmitter) are mapped to the motor speed range (-255 to 255).
   - The values are then adjusted to control the speed and direction of the motors, with appropriate constraints to ensure valid motor speeds.

4. **Timeout Mechanism**:
   - If the RF module doesn't receive a signal for more than `SIGNAL_TIMEOUT` milliseconds, it stops the motors.

### Key Functions:

- **rotateMotor()**: 
   This function controls the rotation of the motors by setting the appropriate pins on the motor driver (left and right motors). It also adjusts the speed of the motors using PWM (Pulse Width Modulation).

# Wireless Motor Controller using nRF24L01

This project allows you to control two motors using an RF module (nRF24L01) over a wireless connection. The motors' directions and speeds are controlled using joystick values sent by the transmitter.

## Features

- **Wireless Motor Control**: Controls two DC motors (left and right) via RF communication.
- **Joystick Input**: The motors' direction and speed are determined by joystick (x and y axis) input from a transmitter.
- **Timeout Mechanism**: Motors stop if no signal is received for a specified timeout period.
- **Motor Driver**: Uses L298N motor driver to control the motors.

## Requirements

- **Hardware**:
  - nRF24L01 Transceiver Module
  - L298N Motor Driver
  - 2 DC Motors
  - Arduino (e.g., Arduino Uno or ESP32)
  
- **Libraries**:
  - `SPI.h`
  - `nRF24L01.h`
  - `RF24.h`
  
## Wiring

- **nRF24L01 Connections**:
  - VCC -> 3.3V (Do not connect to 5V)
  - GND -> GND
  - CE -> Pin 7
  - CSN -> Pin 8
  - SCK -> Pin 13
  - MOSI -> Pin 11
  - MISO -> Pin 12
  - IRQ -> Not connected

- **Motor Driver (L298N) Connections**:
  - IN1 -> Pin 2 (Right Motor)
  - IN2 -> Pin 3 (Right Motor)
  - IN3 -> Pin 4 (Left Motor)
  - IN4 -> Pin 5 (Left Motor)
  - ENA -> Pin 9 (Right Motor Speed Control)
  - ENB -> Pin 10 (Left Motor Speed Control)
  
## Setup

1. Connect the motors, motor driver, and nRF24L01 module to the Arduino according to the wiring instructions.
2. Install the necessary libraries (`SPI`, `nRF24L01`, `RF24`).
3. Upload the code to your Arduino.
4. Open the Serial Monitor to monitor the motor control values and status.
  
## How It Works

- The system listens for data sent by a transmitter via RF. The data consists of joystick values (`xAxisValue`, `yAxisValue`).
- The `xAxisValue` and `yAxisValue` are mapped to control the motors' speed and direction.
- If no data is received for a predefined timeout period (`SIGNAL_TIMEOUT`), the motors stop.

## Example Usage

Once everything is set up, you can control the motors by sending the following data (example values):

```
xAxisValue: 128
yAxisValue: 200
```

This will move the robot forward with some turning adjustments based on the `xAxisValue`.
